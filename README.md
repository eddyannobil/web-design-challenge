# web-design-challenge

For this challenge, a visualization dashboard website is created using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically,a plotting of weather data. 
In building this dashboard, individual pages was created for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. 
These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page is also available where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.


Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.



A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
